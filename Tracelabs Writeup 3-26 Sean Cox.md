For the TraceLabs Search Party CTF happening on 3/26, I focused on Daniel Robinson. This is a writeup explaining what I was able to find and how. 

## Background and Basic Info
Daniel Robinson was last seen the morning of June 23, 2021 leaving his worksite in Buckeye, AZ. He was driving his 2017 blue-grey Jeep Renegade west, towards the desert. He was reported missing later in the day. He is described as a 5'8" African-American man who is missing his right hand.

On July 19th , 2021, less then a month after going missing, a rancher found his car turned on its side at the bottom of a ravine. All of Daniel's personal possession's including keys, phone, wallet, and clothes were found in the vehicle, without any trace of him.

In the time since his disappearance there has been a massive search effort, but it has yet to turn up any leads about his potential location. Interestingly, 2 sets of human remains were found in the search, neither belonging to Daniel Robinson.

## Social Media
My first thought was to find his social media. This could give good insight into the types of people he hanged around with as well as what activities he was involved in. I was unable to find any of his social medias by simply searching his name. The only thing I could find was his LinkedIn page, as a search of his name with LinkedIn returns his account.

Here, we learn some new information. He was a Hydrologist at Matrix New World Engineering, which is a global engineering consulting company. More crucially, we also now learn that he attended College of Charleston. I figured searching his name with College of Charleston might return some results.

Most of the results were simply news articles that mentioned where he went to college, but one was of interest. It was this image:![](https://thelambdas.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/HELP-US-FIND-DANIEL.png)
Tracing back this image, I found that Daniel was a member of the Lambda Theta Phi fraternity at College of Charleston. Using this, I searched for this frat to see what results would come back

The first result is their frat instagram account.

Scrolling almost all the way to the bottom, there are images that feature Daniel. 
**![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/lUesxm5jd1kmIjeNMN07Wjxb4J4Xa5Fyu8nJOPiicsX4MAKhZLis-ninFdTt2ZN-L2TBPaZ68n2INwYyBK4wqXOJ5RhP74qC9OYhju-9eRcOCQt45AAWlQJ4_qqz2DkKSyQrOvUp)**
Crucially, he is tagged in these images, which leads us to his instagram page: 
**![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/059yDG_RwITVj_o9LTJj3pKIIiHmTlvDaQzLc0fJmqg26gM6j9073SfKHjXomvCdGQkN2wctIqe5746NmnJoOhDjZ_OeW3U8_lK0WYKNw0KeX-kKvFiIDrYFjY-fZtTGnbi0q_1R)**
now that we know the username he goes by, we can more easily find his other social media accounts.  Putting this username into a username search engine like https://instantusername.com shows us whether there are accounts on other social media registered with that same username.**![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/moA1DYVNvB73Ds-LGXNFgb7Q_l4sn0bw_zRoy7qO91n7hNA80OFKvc9nonCmB3MIGgKhVL6kBKyRopvCx7E_KFSGK0bdxQqkwVwxIWiS57jpg68gKkla6PkS-iIwcs5o-QEluzNm)**
Using this, i was able to find his TikTok account:

Additionally, he seems to have had other accounts on platforms such as Twitch and Spotify although they have since been deleted.

I submitted all the images featuring Daniel as well as all of his social media accounts.

## School Email
Knowing that Daniel attended College of Charleston, I figured it might be a good idea to try and find his school email. First I searched "college of charleston email login" to attempt to find their format for school emails. which led me to https://it.cofc.edu/accounts-email/index.php, where I found this information:
**![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/BFdJw_STAuNgmSU49OVz15xmLRx82jV59qL92fQzgNd2lVjz0TTduNfwFpuuXRCQWhCBkm2wp12F8mAonLhS_z3XfKxHmmE6lOtlbHBL9LN1PHbJIiO2yZQf1Cr0rLblwHKevcGp)**
Now I needed to find what the format for the username was. This lead me to https://it.cofc.edu/accounts-email/cougars/#:~:text=For%20Students%2C%20your%20username%20is,letter%20of%20your%20fist%20name. where I found this: 
**![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/dR7NFQ4MekXzg3SB5FXaBhr77JcD1QnbuLTm3MdCwy8Dj1W7fWyRCjgaBercoZdWytiNlaLPCRbF8ExUoCl8QcvCtBiPmFsg_x_EFVcqI5Hqt9vq4Stro6B5NnnMGmBjvMv1DC_u)**
Combining this information, I reasoned that Daniel's school email must be danielrc@g.cofc.edu. I then put this info an email validator, https://verify-email.org/ to confirm it is an actual address. 
**![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/VKf5hASK080dJc5H_XXdh1rtkbHVh-E8HuSFm6ZXrIZcckyyLMkDHqFnnK2VYrftkJwSlQa0khyLJ9HwNqxKP7rPWc0k4YbFYQ3Xyh32gUvqPp1DCH6Sn_fNfPuY7B_98OMfYgdT)**
I submitted this information as well as description of how I found it. 

## David Robinson
One part of this story that I found particularly interesting was that of Daniels father, David.  While he is not a suspect by any means, I thought his father was worthy of at least a cursory investigation, if only to get more information about Daniel. I used the same strategy I did with Daniel and found his LinkedIn page: 
**![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Xhw_JOLzLgYQ5kpYf9JckLOrMApy9HJ5zn_eB_LwaGoFSfhONmDUQCTt4tR0oKM3w5SIcQao5KlekRF3WIRG_jvwk5qg_B20eCzm1AZ8MjmWRd0wEncZ1GuGCMKk3jymeA7ZbrFj)**
Through this, I discovered that he is CEO of a company called "Positive Ideologies L.L.C". Following the company link, I found their company website, https://www.positiveideologies.com/
**![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/WvyBu0vvkp1h4Z82x54NIfWVIOjQmg2OxxCVTH6OJa0tqBBfWGlmGCav3Iy6ovcktor625qbl6IAwygoIh1D_cGtV86e4xYSQ5iGlHHSAfcFaM1HSJHhuwpntJ-kaIXnWue0mj-g)**
The companies description reads: "*Positive Ideologies is more than a name; it’s a concept. Everything that we stand for is progressing forward. When it comes to quality, everything that’s created a product or an innovation, Positive Ideologies has your best interest a heart. That’s why you can trust that we will give you exactly what you need and want.* *We welcome you and thank you for visiting our website. We are eager to assist you with obtaining greatness. Right now, we are going through a reset and will have our products available soon. Please check back."*

Scrolling down, you will see David is attempting to sell smart watches under the name *ROGЀ DAFÍDI*, but they are actually just stock images.

scrolling all the way to the bottom, there is a *Visit My Page* button. Clicking it, we are brough to David Robinsons personal site, https://www.davidrobinsonii.com/, where he defines himself as "Your Awesome Public Figure"

Clicking on the "Thoughts" tab, we see a video of him singing, a paragraph detailing his theological viewpoints, a book announcement and perhaps most importantly, a video of him walking up and down stairs in slow motion, simply titled "Walking Up and down"

I submitted all this information about Daniel's father. 
## Conclusion
Overall, I enjoyed TraceLabs CTF. This was my second time doing it, and I think I greatly improved from the first time. I would love to participate again in the future.
